	abstract = {Voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) reduces the risk of male HIV acquisition by 60\%. Programmes to provide male circumcision (MC) to prevent HIV infection have been introduced in sub-Saharan African countries with high HIV burden. While large-scale provision of MMC is recent, traditional MC has long been conducted as part of male coming-of-age practices. How and at what age traditional MC occurs varies by ethnic groups within countries. Accurate estimates of MC coverage by age and type of circumcision (traditional or medical) over time at sub-national levels are essential for planning and delivering VMMCs to meet targets and evaluating their impacts on HIV incidence. In this paper, we developed a Bayesian competing risks time-to-event model to produce region-age-time-type specific probabilities and coverage of MC with probabilistic uncertainty. The model jointly synthesises data from household surveys and health system data on the number of VMMCs conducted. We demonstrated the model using data from five household surveys and VMMC programme data to produce estimates of MC coverage for 52 districts in South Africa between 2008 and 2019. Nationally in 2008, 24.1\% (CI: 23.4-24.8\%) of men aged 15-49 were traditionally circumcised and 19.4\% (CI: 18.9-20.0\%) were medically circumcised. Between 2008 and 2019, five million VMMCs were conducted, and MC coverage among men aged 15-49 increased to 64.0\% (CI: 63.2-64.9\%) and medical MC coverage to 42\% (CI: 41.3-43.0\%). MC coverage varied widely across districts, ranging from 13.4-86.3\%. The average age of traditional MC ranged between 13 to 19 years, depending on local cultural practices.},

	abstract = {Introduction Voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) is one of the key interventions for HIV prevention. However, its uptake among men in Malawi is low. Implementation science strategies for demand creation of VMMC increase uptake. We designed an implementation science demand-creation intervention to increase the uptake of VMMC among men with sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
Methods and analysis We designed a pragmatic pre-interventional and post-interventional quasi-experimental study combined with a prospective observational design to determine the uptake, acceptability, appropriateness and feasibility of a multifaceted intervention for scale up of uptake of VMMC among men with STIs at Bwaila STI clinic in Lilongwe, Malawi. The intervention includes transport reimbursement (R), intensified health education (I) and short messaging service (SMS)/telephonic tracing (Te) (RITe). The intervention will be implemented in phases: pre-implementation and implementation. Pre-implementation phase will be used for collecting baseline data, while the RITe intervention will be rolled-out in the implementation phase. The RITe intervention will be implemented in a sequential and incremental manner called implementation blocks: block 1: intensified health education; block 2: intensified health education and SMS/telephonic tracing; and block 3: intensified health education, SMS/telephonic tracing and transport reimbursement. The target sample size is 80 uncircumcised men for each intervention block, including the pre-implementation sample, making a total of 320 men (280 total, 70 per block will be surveyed). The primary outcome is uptake of VMMC during the implementation period. Mixed methods assessments will be conducted to evaluate the acceptability, appropriateness and feasibility of the RITe intervention.
Ethics and dissemination The study protocol was approved by the Malawi’s National Health Sciences Research Ethics Committee (approval number: 19/10/2412), University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’s Institutional Review Board (approval number: 19–2559) and University of the Witwatersrand’s Health Research Ethics Committee (approval number: M200328). Results will be disseminated via publication in a peer-reviewed journal and presentations at relevant scientific conferences and meetings.

	abstract = {TMB is an open source R package that enables quick implementation of complex nonlinear random eﬀect (latent variable) models in a manner similar to the established AD Model Builder package (ADMB, admb-project.org) (Fournier, Skaug, Ancheta, Ianelli, Magnusson, Maunder, Nielsen, and Sibert 2011). In addition, it oﬀers easy access to parallel computations. The user deﬁnes the joint likelihood for the data and the random eﬀects as a C++ template function, while all the other operations are done in R; e.g., reading in the data. The package evaluates and maximizes the Laplace approximation of the marginal likelihood where the random eﬀects are automatically integrated out. This approximation, and its derivatives, are obtained using automatic diﬀerentiation (up to order three) of the joint likelihood. The computations are designed to be fast for problems with many random eﬀects (≈ 106) and parameters (≈ 103). Computation times using ADMB and TMB are compared on a suite of examples ranging from simple models to large spatial models where the random eﬀects are a Gaussian random ﬁeld. Speedups ranging from 1.5 to about 100 are obtained with increasing gains for large problems. The package and examples are available at http://tmb-project.org.},

	abstract = {Introduction HIV planning requires granular estimates for the number of people living with HIV (PLHIV), antiretroviral treatment (ART) coverage and unmet need, and new HIV infections by district, or equivalent subnational administrative level. We developed a Bayesian small-area estimation model, called Naomi, to estimate these quantities stratified by subnational administrative units, sex, and five-year age groups. Methods Small-area regressions for HIV prevalence, ART coverage and HIV incidence were jointly calibrated using subnational household survey data on all three indicators, routine antenatal service delivery data on HIV prevalence and ART coverage among pregnant women, and service delivery data on the number of PLHIV receiving ART. Incidence was modelled by district-level HIV prevalence and ART coverage. Model outputs of counts and rates for each indicator were aggregated to multiple geographic and demographic stratifications of interest. The model was estimated in an empirical Bayes framework, furnishing probabilistic uncertainty ranges for all output indicators. Example results were presented using data from Malawi during 2016–2018. Results Adult HIV prevalence in September 2018 ranged from 3.2\% to 17.1\% across Malawi's districts and was higher in southern districts and in metropolitan areas. ART coverage was more homogenous, ranging from 75\% to 82\%. The largest number of PLHIV was among ages 35 to 39 for both women and men, while the most untreated PLHIV were among ages 25 to 29 for women and 30 to 34 for men. Relative uncertainty was larger for the untreated PLHIV than the number on ART or total PLHIV. Among clients receiving ART at facilities in Lilongwe city, an estimated 71\% (95\% CI, 61\% to 79\%) resided in Lilongwe city, 20\% (14\% to 27\%) in Lilongwe district outside the metropolis, and 9\% (6\% to 12\%) in neighbouring Dowa district. Thirty-eight percent (26\% to 50\%) of Lilongwe rural residents and 39\% (27\% to 50\%) of Dowa residents received treatment at facilities in Lilongwe city. Conclusions The Naomi model synthesizes multiple subnational data sources to furnish estimates of key indicators for HIV programme planning, resource allocation, and target setting. Further model development to meet evolving HIV policy priorities and programme need should be accompanied by continued strengthening and understanding of routine health system data.},
